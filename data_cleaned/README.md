# 9/16: Data Ready

You should have your data set available for mining and modeling. The steps may include:

* data retrieval
* data cleaning
* data transformation and filtering
* feature scaling
* missing data handling
* noise removal
* feature engineering
* ...

In this milestone, you will need to post **at least 3 plots** created based on your data set and submit them to your github repo. You will give a short (< 90 seconds) presentation to the class using the plots to demonstrate one or more of the following:

* the distribution(s) of the data points
* if there are any outliers
* if scaling and normalization is required and why
* how do you plan to handle missing data
* what features are significant
* any other insights and fun facts that you discovered from the data set
