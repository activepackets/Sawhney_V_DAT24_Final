# 10/14: Quick Draft Due Before Class

**Submission Link:** [TBA](blank)

Your peers and instructors will provide feedback by 10/19, according to [these guidelines](peer_review_guidelines.md).

At a minimum, you should include:
* Narrative of what you have done so far and what you are still planning to do, ideally in a format similar to the format of your final project paper
* Code, with lots of comments

Ideally, you would also include:
* Visualizations you have done
* Slides (if you have started making them)
* Data and data dictionary

Tips for success:
* The work should stand "on its own", and should not depend upon the reader remembering anything you might have previously said in class about your project.
* Organize your narrative and files so that the reader can easily follow along.
* The better you explain your project, and the easier it is to follow, the more useful feedback you will receive!
* If your reviewers can actually run your code on the provided data, they will be able to give you more useful feedback on your code. (It can be very hard to make useful code suggestions on code that can't be run!)
