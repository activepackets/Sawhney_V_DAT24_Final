# Course Project


## Overview

The final project is an opportunity to apply what you learn in this course to a problem of your choosing. Not only is the final project an interesting learning opportunity, it will also become a valuable part of your data science portfolio. Real code applied to a real problem and available on Github is more powerful for many employers than any bullet point on a written resume.

Please note that completion of a final project, including presenting it to the class, is a requirement for a Certificate of Completion for the course.

The best final projects tend to be driven by curiosity. Therefore, we recommend that you pick a topic that you're passionate about. If you have a strong interest in the domain, then it will be more engaging and fun for you. As a result, you'll produce a better project!

In the past, students have completed final projects directly related to their current role, a field to which they want to transition, or areas of personal interest, such as fantasy sports and cooking.

Sources of potential inspiration include:

* Your work
* Cool projects you see online
* Stanford's CS229 final projects from recent years:
	* http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects2014.html
	* http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects2013.html

Another great source of inspiration is checking out [publicly available data sets](public_data_sources.md). You may also use a private data set that is available to you. If you choose to use a private data set, you may want to pay the $7/month to have a private Github repo for your final project code or upload the data set to dropbox and share with the instructor team. You are **not** required to post the dataset publicly. However, the instructor team will usually need access to the data set in order to evaluate your final project. Also, remember that you must present your project and what you learned in class. Again, there is no requirement to share the dataset itself, other than as mentioned above.

Feel free to reach out to the instructor team and to consult each other when considering different project options. We are happy to chat about different ideas.


## Project Deliverables

You are responsible for creating a **project paper** and a **project presentation**. The paper should be written with a technical audience in mind, while the presentation should target a more general audience. You will deliver your presentation (including slides) during the final week of class, on October 19 and October 21.

Your **paper** should cover the following:

* Problem statement and hypothesis
* Description of your data set and how it was obtained
* Description of any pre-processing / data-munging steps
* What you learned from exploring the data, including visualizations
* How you chose which features to use in your analysis
* Details of your modeling process, including how you selected your models and validated them
* Your challenges and successes
* Possible extensions or business applications of your project
* Conclusions and key learnings

Your **presentation** should cover these components with less breadth and less depth. Focus on creating an engaging, clear, and informative presentation that tells the story of your project.

Create a GitHub repository for your project -- under your userid -- that contains the following:

* **Project paper:** PDF
* **Presentation slides:** PDF
* **Code:** commented Python code and any other code you used in the project
* **Data:** data files (see below for more info)
* **Data dictionary:** description of each variable, including units

If it's not possible or practical to include your entire dataset, you should link to your data source and provide a sample of the data. (GitHub has a [size limit](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota/) of 100 MB per file and 1 GB per repository.) If your data is private, you can either include an "anonymized" version of your data or create a private GitHub repository. Or you may also upload your data set to dropbox/Google drive and share with the instructional team.
